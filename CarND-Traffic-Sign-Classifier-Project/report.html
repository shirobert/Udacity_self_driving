<p><strong>Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project</strong></p>
<p>The goals / steps of this project are the following: * Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set) * Explore, summarize and visualize the data set * Design, train and test a model architecture * Use the model to make predictions on new images * Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images * Summarize the results with a written report</p>

Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the &quot;Stand Out Suggestions&quot; part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale and then normalization. Normalized data helps Gradient Descent (or similar algorithms) to converge quickly. Hence, data normalization is one of the key preprocessing steps when it comes to data preprocessing.</li>
<li><p>One-Hot Encoding was used to convert label numbers to vectors.</p></li>

Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.</h4>
<p>My final model results were:</p>
<ul>
<li>validation set accuracy of 0.931</li>
<li>test set accuracy of 0.916</li>
</ul>
<p>If an iterative approach was chosen: * What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen: LeNet-5, as it was successfully used to classify digits image. * What were some problems with the initial architecture, it won't capture some of the features. * Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why? I didn't changed the architecture of LeNet-5, just changed some of its parameters, the number of epochs and the batch size, tried different combination and finallized the result. * How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well? : The result is acceptable, not great. the difference between validation set result and test data set result is small and acceptable, meaning it is not underfitting or overfitting.</p>

<p>For the other images, the model can't predict right. One of the reason is that those images are not in or similar to the training data set, so it is hard for the model to preidct right. secondly.</p>
